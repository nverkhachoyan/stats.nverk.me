1. **Overview of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**
   - MLE is a method used for estimating the parameters of a statistical model.
   - It involves finding the parameter values that make the observed data most probable under the assumed statistical model.

2. **Likelihood**
   - The likelihood is a function that represents the probability of observing the given data under various parameter values of a statistical model.
   - Formula: $$ \mathcal{L}(\theta | x) = P(X = x | \theta) $$
     - Where $$ \theta $$ represents the parameters of the model and $$ x $$ is the observed data.

3. **Intuition Behind MLE**
   - The core idea is to choose the parameter values ($$ \theta $$) that maximize the likelihood function, making the observed data as likely as possible.
   - MLE adjusts the parameters to locate the peak of the likelihood function, signifying the most probable parameters for the given data.

4. **MLE Using Calculus**
   - The goal is to find the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function.
   - **Steps:**
     1. **Define the Likelihood Function**: $$ \mathcal{L}(\theta | x) $$.
     2. **Log-Likelihood**: Convert to log-likelihood for simplification: $$ \ln(\mathcal{L}(\theta | x)) $$. This step is beneficial because it often simplifies the multiplication of probabilities into a sum, making differentiation easier.
     3. **Differentiation**: Find the derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to $$ \theta $$: $$ \frac{d}{d\theta} \ln(\mathcal{L}(\theta | x)) $$.
     4. **Set Derivative to Zero**: To find the maximum, set the derivative equal to zero: $$ \frac{d}{d\theta} \ln(\mathcal{L}(\theta | x)) = 0 $$.
     5. **Solve for $$ \theta $$**: Solve this equation to find the value of $$ \theta $$ that maximizes the likelihood.

5. **Example of MLE in Practice**
   - Suppose you have a set of data and assume it is normally distributed. You would use MLE to estimate the mean ($$ \mu $$) and variance ($$ \sigma^2 $$) of this distribution.
   - The likelihood function in this case would be based on the normal distribution formula, and you would maximize this function with respect to $$ \mu $$ and $$ \sigma^2 $$ using the steps outlined above.
