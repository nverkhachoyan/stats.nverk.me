Hey there! This is just a web page for my statistics notes. I will be making separate pages for each topic I think is important for me to learn. These may not be comprehensive, but they should cover the basics! :)

I will use LaTex to write out the formulas. I might also use Python to do some stats, for example. 


```python
import numpy as np
data = [1,9,10]
mean = np.mean(data)

print(mean) // 6.666667
```
